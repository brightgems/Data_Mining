# Airbnb New User Bookings
 
Predicting Airbnb user's first booking destination using Data Mining.

### Installation Requirements : 
  
To run this project, you will need Jupyter - an interative iPython environment that runs in your web browser. The easiest way is to install Ananconda - https://www.continuum.io/downloads 

#### Models_1 : 

This folder contains two iPython notebooks Preprocessing+Modeling and GradientBoosting_Analysis. 
Each notebook contains comprehensive steps to preprocess the data and run the models individually. The notebooks require train_users2.csv and sessions.csv to be in the same folder as the notebooks. 

Preprocessing+Modeling : This notebook has analysis on Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Gaussian Naive Bayes, AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting Classifiers.

GradientBoosting_Analysis : This notebook focuses on the Gradient Boosting Classifier.


#### Models_2 :


#### Models_3 : 

This folder contains the iPython notebooks to model using Decision Tree and Random Forest. 
The Preprocessing.ipynb contains the preprocessing file which requires the train_users_2.csv and test_users.csv to be in the same folder as the notebook. This will produce an output preprocessed_airbnb_train.csv and preprocessed_airbnb_test.csv .

The DecisionTree.ipynb notebook has the DecisionTree models. The RandomForest.ipynb notebook has the RandomForest models. To run this notebook, preprocessed_airbnb_train.csv has to be there in the same folder as the notebooks. A copy of the generated preprocessed_airbnb_train.csv is already available in the Models_3 folder.

The Experiments.ipynb notebook contains some experiments like binary classification, three class classification and some interesting findings observed while building those models.This also requires the preprocessed_airbnb_train.csv to be in the same folder as the notebook.
